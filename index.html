    <p>I've been mind controlled by aliens and the government starting around the middle of 2018, about six months before an article came out about me in <i>NY Magazine</i>, <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/12/the-unabomber-ted-kaczynski-new-generation-of-acolytes.html">"Children of Ted."</a> (The article is nonsense, and more than once it tells blatant falsehoods, including a fake quote, but I was already six months into being mind controlled and didn't have the ability to explain. I even visited him but couldn't muster the ability to explain that intelligent forces were messing with my reality. At the time I thought most people were somehow in on it, and didn't have much of an idea yet of what was going on or how bad it was going to be.)</p>
    <p>Anyway since then (7 1/2 years in 2026) I've suffered from mind control and remote and paranormal physical attacks on my mind and body. These intelligences can warp reality as well.</p>
    <p>Much of this is somehow mainstream on another plane, but my initiatic or counter-initiatic process went poorly, so I can't tell how much is supposed to be an unspoken joke. I know I look foolish. Any initiated mason or thelemite, or anyone initiated into the high Christian mysteries, knows at least <em>some</em> of this — and that's most of the people in our government. I can't tell if it's on the "House" level of politics or the "Senate" level of politics that people start understanding these realities about non-human intelligences, consciousness, etc. I know I was supposed to end up somewhere and not ranting on the internet schizophrenically.</p>
    <p>These entities are still messing with me (Feb 2026) and have caused major psychological and physical health damage. Please <a href="https://connect.vestwell.com/gifting/calable/-xpmtOMaiUKrPLz_v7MKrg/start">donate</a> to help me regain direction of my life.</p>
